# README

Redwood polling application. Built inially for the 'State of Startups' poll, as referenced here: https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/rfc-state-of-redwood-startups-poll/3771

## Goals

To create a poll, to create questions and answers, and to collect user votes and any custom answers.
Ideally multiple polls could be created within the application.
Polls could be opened and closed as needed.
Results from the polls could also be aggregated at any time.
When closed, results could be toggled to be visible or not?

How to balance between an open poll with no log-in required, but also saving user's answers for future visits?
Easy answer is log-in is required.
But that will gate users and lower overall participation.
Since polling the RW community is a new thing, we might want to encourage maximum participation.
